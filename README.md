# Payment Status Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project applies **logistic regression** to predict payment status (paid / not paid) based on customer features.  
It demonstrates data encoding, model training/testing, and interpretation of results using **odds ratios**.

## Key Findings

Data Preparation: Applied binary encoding for gender, marital status, city, and province; ordinal encoding for education and age range.

Model Accuracy: Achieved accuracy on test data but observed overfitting (model performed better on training data).

Feature Impact (Odds Ratio):

ðŸ“ˆ Features increasing odds of non-payment:

Appcount (1.31) â†’ each additional application increases odds of non-payment by 31%.

Education (1.20) â†’ higher education slightly increases default risk.

City_2 (1.21) â†’ living in certain cities increases non-payment odds.

ðŸ“‰ Features reducing odds of non-payment:

FICO Score (0.58) â†’ higher credit score reduces odds of non-payment by 42%.

Salary (0.67) â†’ higher income reduces odds by 33%.

Married Status (0.68) â†’ being married lowers risk.

## Project Workflow

Step 1: Encode categorical variables (binary & ordinal encoding).

Step 2: Train logistic regression model (90% train, 10% test).

Step 3: Evaluate model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Step 4: Interpret model coefficients using odds ratios.
